# Project: Python - More Classes and Objects

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#odds-and-ends) (Read the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#classmethod-and-staticmethod-decorators)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](https://realpython.com/lessons/str-vs-repr/)
